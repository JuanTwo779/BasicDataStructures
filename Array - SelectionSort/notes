select head as current min
look for smallest value in elements towards tail
switch smallest item with head
move to next element away from head - new current min

CODE
1. For loop for first index of array
        bound should be length -1 because we need to compare value with element to the right
2. int minIndex = i
3. Nest for loop j = i + 1 //value to the right
        bound is just length
4. If statement (array[j] < array[i])
        true: set new minIndex to j
5. In first loop, set up int tempValue = array[minIndex]
        the value in mindex is stored
6. array[minIndex] = array[i]
        the bigger value found in [i] is moved to the right
7. array[i] = tempValue
        the smaller value stored in tempValue is moved to the place of the old min
