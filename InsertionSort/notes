Recursively traversing through the given array, comparing each value with the values before it.
If a minimal value is encountered, it is moved to the position where it is no longer the minimal value.
This process repeats until the entire array is sorted

position elements in an array in a certain order

1. Copy element into temp variable
2. Compare variable to elements towards the start of the array
3. If element is larger than variable, element is moved up and variable takes it's place

CODE
1. For loop to walk through array, i starts at 1
nest
2. Copy value loop is on to a temp value
3. Intialise j = i - 1; to look back in the array later
4. While loop (j >= 0 && array[j] > temp value)
nest
5. array[j+1] = array[j] ((element in array[j] is place in current value of for loop))
6. decrement j to move down array, while loops stops when j disproves condition
outside while
7. array[j + 1] = temp value ((j + 1 because the while loop has decremented it))
